=========================
Welcome to "Project Site"
=========================

New projects need a website... a place on the web to explain all the relevant parts of the project. This is usually a pain, and not something you want to be distracted by when you start a new project.

Project Site is a simple way to generate a website for your new project. All you need to do is run a few commands, and then add pages to your site at your leisure. You can write pages in your favorite markup languages, like POD or reStructuredText or Socialtext or just HTML. See the "SETUP" file for more information.

Project Site is used for the following websites:

* http://www.acmeism.org/
* http://www.cdent.org/
* http://www.testml.org/
* http://www.stardoc.org/

Project Site is currently very minimal. If you want to add features, just do so and send me a pull request.

If you use Project Site for a website, please let me know so I can add your site to the above list.
