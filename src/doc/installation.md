Installing ProjectSite is really simple.

Just clone the GitHub repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/ingydotnet/project-site
```

Then enable it in your shell by sourcing the `.rc` file:
```
source /path/to/project-site/.rc
```

If you want to make it permanent, just add that last command to your Bash or Zsh (or other POSIX-ish) shell startup file.
